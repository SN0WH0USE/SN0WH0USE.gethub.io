i statreted with my megeman file from last week for a base. the first thing i changed was the shot.
by creating a new varialbe for the shots x position (lemx) and adding a ++ stament to the variable i was able to have the shot move rathe
than teleport, defining the variable outside of the draw function keeps it fro getting locked in place. by leaving the mouse released variable the same as before it ensures that the shot returns to its start position.
